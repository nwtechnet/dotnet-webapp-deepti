My approach:
=======================================================================

I choose to use javascript on the frontend to do search of username in 
GitHub API to save a trip to the server, rather than send request to server
and have server send request to GitHub API I choose to make the call from
the frontend with Javascript.  I believe this approach is mor efficient.

When displaying user profile it seemed like a good idea to use the same javascript
method displaying the data to create form inputs so the profile could be added to
favorites.

To efficiently handle CRUD operations I choose to the Repository pattern which makes
wiring up CRUD operations models and controllers straight forward.

If I had more time I would have:
=======================================================================

I would have added more validation around not being to add duplicate
favorites.

I would have wired in a SQL Server database.

I would have also made the front-end look prettier and showed some versatility by 
coding frontend in Angular and React.

I had some home improvement projects going on for the past few weeks so my time
was limited to complete this assignment.
